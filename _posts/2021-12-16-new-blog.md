Hello, welcome to the [dvigne.github.io]({{ site.url }}) blog, my name is Derick Vigne. At the time of writing this blog post, I am a 25 year old Software Engineer with multiple years experience in Embedded Linux and robotics. Over the course of my own professional career as well as time spent building hobby projects in my own lab, I have gained experience, tools, and useful text based resources that I reference quite frequently. It is my goal that, through this site, I may share them with you as well and these writings will be useful to you in some capacity. Navigating the site is simple, navigate to the [Blog]({% link blog.html %}) page and from there, every post ever created is sorted by category which you can use to filter down through all of the posts. I am always open to questions, concerns, feedback, or otherwise. Plase feel free to email me at [derickvigne@me.com](mailto:derickvigne@me.com). Enjoy!
