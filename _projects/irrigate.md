Irrigate is a project that consists of two parts. The hardware based valve controller and the microcode software that was primarily written for the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller platform.

It was built and designed to operate up to 4 distinct zones and provide an easy to use web interface for controlling it. Through the web interface you can change and set the time, change or add times when each zone activates, manually activate a given zone, and modify global system settings.
